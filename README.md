Fluxity is a token streaming solution designed to enhance the efficiency of financial transactions within the Stellar blockchain ecosystem. By enabling real-time transfer of cryptographic tokens, Fluxity introduces a new paradigm in financial interactions, fostering dynamic ecosystems.

**Token Streaming as a Solution**

Token streaming provides an innovative solution, offering real-time, continuous transactions that can be adapted to various use cases, ensuring attractiveness, flexibility, and trust in financial engagements. It allows for an ongoing flow of tokens, similar to streaming media content, with predefined start and stop times and transfer rates, providing both parties with predictable, fluid transactions. Token streams can be cancellable and offer maximum flexibility to payment configurations at slashed transaction costs.

**Key Features**

- **Flexible Token Streaming**: Choose between linear or exponential token streaming to suit your needs.
- **Cliff Streams**: Delay token distribution to incentivize commitment and discourage speculative behavior.
- **Vesting Streams**: Create streams where tokens unlock daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly based on preferred rates set during creation.
